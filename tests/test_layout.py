"""Layout measurement harness: assert the *rendered geometry*, not the tag
properties that were asked for.

Everything else in this suite checks what went into the buffer. These tests
check what GTK did with it, via `Gtk.TextView.get_iter_location()` and
`get_line_yrange()`, so "the spacing regressed" can be a failing test rather
than a feeling. Numbers are in em -- multiples of the base font size -- never
pixels, because the font differs between machines (Adwaita Sans on a GNOME
desktop, DejaVu Sans in CI's container) and only the ratios are comparable.

Four things about measuring a Gtk.TextView were established by experiment and
are easy to get wrong (each one silently produces plausible-looking numbers
rather than an error):

1. **An unallocated view reports zero for everything vertical.** `x` and the
   per-line text height come out correct, `y` and `get_line_yrange()` are all
   0, so every computed gap is 0 and the spacing looks perfect. Realizing is
   not what fixes this -- allocating is. `_measure` therefore always calls
   `Gtk.Widget.allocate()` and `assert_valid_geometry` guards it.

2. **CSS font-size only reaches the layout once the window is presented.**
   The widget's Pango context reports the new size as soon as the provider
   loads, even unparented, but the TextView's own layout keeps the old
   metrics until it is presented -- confirmed divergent between a desktop
   (realize() was enough) and CI's Xvfb (it was not). Since zoom.py pins the
   base font via CSS, and that pinning is what makes numbers comparable
   across machines at all, every measurement here goes through present().

3. **With no window manager the window ignores its requested size.** Under
   Xvfb a `default_width=700` window is allocated 640, so the width is forced
   with an explicit `allocate()` *after* present() -- otherwise the wrap
   points, and anything derived from them, are whatever Xvfb's screen size
   happens to make them.

4. **A live zoom change needs a real main loop iteration to take effect.**
   Draining already-pending events is not enough; the relayout arrives on a
   frame-clock tick. `_settle` runs an actual GLib.MainLoop until the font
   size it is waiting for shows up, which doubles as the guard that the CSS
   landed at all.

See also tests/conftest.py, which pins GSK_RENDERER -- presenting a window
under GTK's default renderer aborts outright where there is no GL.
