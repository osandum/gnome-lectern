"""Test-wide setup that has to happen before anything imports Gtk.

`GSK_RENDERER=cairo`: test_layout.py presents a real Gtk.Window, and GTK's
default (GL) renderer *aborts the process* -- SIGABRT, core dumped, no
catchable exception -- when it can't open libGLESv2, which is the case in a
bare container with only the packages CI installs. The cairo renderer needs
no GL at all and produces byte-identical geometry (verified against the GL
renderer on a desktop and against mesa-libGLES/mesa-dri-drivers in a Fedora
container). Set here rather than only in CI so a `podman run` or a slimmed
desktop can't core-dump the suite; the workflow sets it too, so the reason
is visible where the failure would otherwise appear.

Nothing else in the suite realizes a window, so this affects test_layout.py
alone -- but the variable is read when a renderer is first created, which
is too late to set from inside a test module that has already imported Gtk.
