# Lectern kitchen sink

This fixture exercises every feature Lectern v1 is expected to render.

## Headings

### Level three
#### Level four
##### Level five
###### Level six

## Inline formatting

Some **bold text**, some *italic text*, some **bold with *nested italic*
inside it**, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

## Lists

- Unordered item one
- Unordered item two
  - Nested unordered item
    - Doubly nested item
- Unordered item three

1. Ordered item one
2. Ordered item two
   1. Nested ordered item
3. Ordered item three

## Task list

- [ ] An unchecked task
- [x] A checked task
- [ ] Another unchecked task

## Blockquote

> This is a blockquote.
> It spans multiple source lines that should join into one paragraph.

## Code

Inline `code()` in a sentence.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a


class Example:
    """A docstring."""

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
```

A fenced block in a language Lectern has never heard of, to exercise the
`guess_lexer` fallback path:

```blorpiscript
frobnicate(x, y) => x <~> y;
```

A long fenced block, deliberately oversized, to exercise print pagination
across multiple pages:

## Table

| Feature      | Supported | Notes                        |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Tables       | Yes       | Column widths sized by median cell length |
| Task lists   | Yes       | Read-only glyphs              |
| Footnotes    | Yes       | Click to jump                 |
| Editing      | No        | This is a viewer              |

## Mermaid diagrams

A `mermaid` fence is drawn rather than listed:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Open([Open file]) --> Parse[markdown-it-py]
    Parse --> Walk{Node type?}
    Walk -- block --> Buffer[(TextBuffer)]
    Walk -- table --> Grid[[Gtk.Grid]]
    Walk -. mermaid .-> Scene((Scene))
    Buffer --> Show[Present window]
    Grid --> Show
    Scene --> Show
```

Top-down, with a loop back to an earlier node:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Watch[Watch the file] --> Changed{Changed?}
    Changed -->|yes| Reload[Re-render]
    Reload --> Watch
    Changed -->|no| Watch
```

Nested `subgraph` frames, labels broken over two lines with `\n`, and an
invisible `~~~` link placing a node nothing points at:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Source["Markdown\nsource"] --> Walk{Node type?}
    subgraph Pass["One walk, two outputs"]
        subgraph Screen["Screen"]
            Buffer[(TextBuffer)]
        end
        subgraph Paper["Paper"]
            Model["print_model\nPrintItem list"]
        end
    end
    Walk --> Buffer
    Walk --> Model
    Model ~~~ Note["Same walk, same order"]
```

A sequence diagram, with a frame and a note:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Window
    participant R as Renderer
    W->>+R: render(tree, buffer)
    R->>R: walk block nodes
    Note right of R: tables and diagrams<br/>become anchored widgets
    loop every block
        R->>R: append a PrintItem
    end
    R-->>-W: print_model
```

A class diagram and an entity-relationship diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction LR
    class PrintItem {
        +str kind
        +list runs
        +int gap
    }
    class Renderer {
        <<walker>>
        +render(tree, buffer)
    }
    Renderer --> "many" PrintItem : appends
```

```mermaid
erDiagram
    DOCUMENT ||--o{ BLOCK : contains
    BLOCK ||--|{ RUN : "is made of"
    DOCUMENT {
        string path
        string title
    }
```

A diagram type this viewer doesn't draw falls back to the code block, so
the source stays readable rather than being silently dropped:

```mermaid
gantt
    title Not drawn
    section One
    Task :a1, 2026-01-01, 30d
```

## Links

A regular [link to example.com](https://example.com) and an explicit
autolink <https://example.com/autolink>.

## Images

A local image, resolved relative to this file's own directory:

![a lectern with a page resting on it](images/lectern.svg)

A small image sits ![a green dot](images/dot.svg) inline in the text,
rather than alone in its own paragraph. Markdown has no way to ask for a
size, so every image is shown at its own — which is why this one is an
icon rather than the picture above.

## Footnotes

Here is a claim that needs a citation.[^1] Here is a second one.[^2]

[^1]: The first footnote's definition text.
[^2]: The second footnote's definition, with **bold** inside it.
