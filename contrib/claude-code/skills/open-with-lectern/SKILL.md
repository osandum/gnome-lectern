description: Use right after writing a standalone Markdown deliverable (a report, summary, plan, writeup, or similar .md file meant for the user to read) to disk, in ANY project — not just when asked to. Instead of just naming the file path, also open it in Lectern, the user's GTK Markdown viewer. Trigger whenever the next thing you'd otherwise do is say "I've saved this to <path>.md" or similar. Do not trigger for incidental files (configs, code, data) or for .md files that are project source (docs, README, AGENTS.md) rather than a generated deliverable.

# Open with Lectern

The user reads generated Markdown deliverables with
[Lectern](https://github.com/osandum/lectern), a native GTK4/Libadwaita
Markdown viewer, rather than in the terminal or an editor. Whenever you
write a Markdown file that *is* the deliverable — a report, summary,
research writeup, plan, comparison, etc. — open it in Lectern as the
last step, instead of just telling the user where the file is.

## Steps

1. Finish writing the file as normal.
2. Check a viewer is plausible before trying to launch one:
   - `command -v lectern` — if missing, Lectern isn't installed here;
     skip launching and just report the path as usual (don't mention
     the skill or apologize for it).
   - A display is reachable — `$DISPLAY` or `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set.
     Over a headless SSH session with neither, skip launching too.
3. Launch it detached, so it doesn't block and doesn't die when the
   turn ends:
   ```sh
   setsid lectern /absolute/path/to/file.md >/dev/null 2>&1 &
   disown
   ```
   Use the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true` as an alternative to
   `setsid`/`disown` if that's more convenient — either way, don't wait
   on it and don't treat a nonzero/unknown exit as an error worth
   surfacing.
4. Mention in your reply that you opened it — a short "opened in
   Lectern" alongside the path is enough, no need to explain the
   mechanism.

## Non-goals

- Don't launch Lectern for files you edited that are part of a
  repo's existing docs (README.md, AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.) —
  only for a fresh document generated as this turn's output.
- Don't launch it more than once per file per turn, and don't re-open
  it on subsequent edits to the same file within the same
  conversation — once is enough, the user can switch back to it (and
  Lectern auto-reloads on change anyway).
- If the user is actively working *in* the lectern/mdview repo itself,
  use ordinary judgment — this skill is about generated deliverables in
  other settings, not about dogfooding every fixture file.
