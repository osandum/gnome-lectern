"""Pygments wrapper: turns fenced-code text into (text, tag_name) runs.

Deliberately does not embed a GtkSourceView per code block -- tagging text
directly in the shared TextBuffer is far cheaper for documents with many
fences, and keeps the print model (tags.py) as the single source of truth
for how a token type is colored on screen vs. on paper.

All `pygments` imports are deliberately deferred into highlight_runs()
(mirroring document.py's lazy markdown_it import) -- a document with no
fenced code blocks, or a bare `lectern` launch, shouldn't pay for pygments'
lexer registry at all.
