    Floored, per column, at that column's own longest single word (e.g.
    the header "Supported" against otherwise-short "Yes"/"No" data) --
    without this, a narrow-but-wordy column can end up assigned less
    width than its own unbreakable header word needs. On screen this is
    harmless (Gtk.Label never breaks a word mid-way regardless of what
    width it's asked for), but printing.py's Pango layouts use
    WORD_CHAR wrapping and *will* hyphenlessly break a word that doesn't

    floor was added.
