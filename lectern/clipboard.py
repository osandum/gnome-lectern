"""Copy: put text/html and a text/markdown flavour on the clipboard
alongside plain text, so pasting a Lectern selection into a rich-text-
aware app (mail, chat, office) or a Markdown editor keeps its
formatting. Gtk.TextView's default copy-clipboard handler only ever
puts plain text on the clipboard, discarding every Gtk.TextTag.

Images and diagrams get their real pixels embedded as a data: URI
directly in the HTML (any number of them, not just one -- see
_image_data_uri/_diagram_data_uri), and a loaded image additionally
gets its own image/png clipboard flavour when the selection is
*exactly* one (make_content_provider's image_texture, for a paste
target that only understands raw image data, not HTML at all -- no
well-defined single image/* payload exists for more than one).

Driven off the live Gtk.TextBuffer and its tags for the *selected
range only* -- unlike printing.py, which works off the whole
document's print_model instead. A selection is a buffer range, not a
print item, and print_model carries no buffer offsets to slice by, so
there's nothing to reuse there; tag names are the one place formatting
lives on screen, so that's what gets walked here too.

A table is reconstructed (a real <table> / GFM pipe table) from the
plain-text grid MarkdownRenderer.anchor_descriptors carries for it --
the buffer itself only holds a single object-replacement character
standing in for the whole thing, but a table's cell text is readily
available outside the buffer. Each cell is also already separately,
natively copyable on its own (every cell is a selectable Gtk.Label,
which binds Ctrl+C itself; see tables.py) -- this module's
reconstruction is for a selection spanning the *whole* table, not a
replacement for that.

A mermaid diagram has no reasonable *text* form at all -- rasterized
into a PNG data URI for HTML instead (same idea as an image's embedded
pixels, see _diagram_data_uri), but left out of the Markdown flavour
entirely: a bare base64 blob with no alt text worth keeping would only
bloat what's supposed to be readable source, unlike HTML, where the
src attribute is already URL-shaped machinery rather than human-facing
text.
