"""Layered graph layout, shared by every box-and-arrow diagram type.

A cut-down Sugiyama: rank the nodes into layers along the diagram's
direction, order each layer to unpick crossings, then place them across
the layer. That's the shape of the algorithm dagre (what mermaid itself
uses) implements, minus the parts that need a solver -- ordering is
barycentre sweeps rather than an optimal ordering, and cross-axis
placement is priority-based rather than a network simplex. The difference
shows as slightly wider spacing and the odd avoidable crossing on dense
graphs, not as unreadable output.

Callers supply their own node and edge objects; this module only requires
that a node carries `key`, `w`, `h` (already sized) and accepts `x`, `y`,
`rank`, `order`, and that an edge carries `src` and `dst` keys. What the
boxes look like -- a flowchart's shapes, a class diagram's compartments --
is the caller's business entirely, and is why this file draws nothing.
