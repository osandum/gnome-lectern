"""The drawing-primitive layer every diagram type lays out into.

A `Scene` is deliberately dumb: absolute geometry in nominal 96dpi pixels
(the same unit tags.py and renderer.py measure in, so printing.py's `pt()`
is all that stands between it and paper) plus *role names* instead of
colours. Roles are resolved at draw time, which is what lets one scene
draw into a light window, a dark window and a print job without being
laid out again -- the same split tags.py maintains between a tag's shape
and its palette.
