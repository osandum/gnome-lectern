"""`flowchart` / `graph`: source -> node-and-edge model -> Scene.

The layout is a cut-down Sugiyama: rank the nodes into layers along the
diagram's direction, order each layer to unpick crossings, then assign
positions across the layer. That is the same shape of algorithm dagre
(what mermaid itself uses) implements, minus the parts that need a solver
-- ordering is barycentre sweeps rather than an optimal ordering, and
cross-axis placement is priority-based rather than a network simplex. The
difference shows up as slightly wider spacing and the odd avoidable
crossing on dense graphs, not as unreadable output.

Parsing is deliberately strict: anything this module doesn't understand
raises Unsupported, and the caller falls back to rendering the fence as a
highlighted code block. A diagram drawn *wrongly* is worse than one not
drawn at all -- the reader can't tell a mis-parse from what the author
meant, whereas the code block is at least honest.
