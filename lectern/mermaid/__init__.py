"""Mermaid diagrams drawn natively, no browser involved.

A ```mermaid fence is parsed here into a diagram model, laid out into a
`scene.Scene` of absolute geometry, and painted with cairo -- on screen by
`view.DiagramView` and on paper by printing.py, from the same scene code.
That mirrors how the rest of Lectern works (native GTK, never HTML), and
it is the only option that keeps a diagram in the printed document: the
alternative backends are a headless browser (mermaid-cli, which a Flatpak
can't run and which costs hundreds of milliseconds a diagram) or a remote
render service, which would post the document's contents to a third party
on open -- exactly what images.py refuses to do.

The cost is coverage. This draws the mermaid *subset* Lectern
understands; anything else -- an unsupported diagram type, a construct
the parser doesn't know, a syntax error -- raises Unsupported and
renderer.py falls back to showing the fence as a highlighted code block.
That fallback is the design, not a stopgap: a diagram drawn from a
half-understood source is worse than an honest listing, because the
reader has no way to tell it from what the author wrote.
